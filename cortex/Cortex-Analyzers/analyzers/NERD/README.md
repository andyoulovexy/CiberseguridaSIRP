### Nerd 
Project [Nerd](https://nerd.cesnet.cz/) aims to build an extensive reputation database of known sources of cyber threats. That is, a list of known malicious IP addresses or other network entities (e.g. ASNs or domain names) together with all security-relevant information about each of them.

The analyzer comes in a single flavour that will return additional information categorization for provided ip.

#### Requirements
You need a valid Nerd API integration subscription to use the analyzer.

- Provide your API key as values for the `key` parameter.
- Default url of NERD instance is provided for `url` parameter but you could override it.
